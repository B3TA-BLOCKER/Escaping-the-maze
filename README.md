# Pattern_generation
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a maze solver using backtracking. The program takes a square matrix as input, where `0` represents closed blocks and `1` represents open blocks. The objective is to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the maze, moving only through the open blocks.
